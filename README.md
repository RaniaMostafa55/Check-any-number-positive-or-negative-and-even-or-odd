Task3

A new Dart project.

## Getting Started

This project helps you determine if the number is even or odd, positive or negative by these steps:
1. Print a message asking the user to enter an integer number
2. Take a number from the user as a string
3. Check if the input from the user is not empty, then , convert it to integer and store it into "number" variable
4. If the input from the user is empty, then, store 0 in "number" variable
5. Use "if statement" to check if the "number" value is more than 0, then, it's a positive numebr
6. Check if the "number" value is less than 0, then it's a negative numebr
7. If the "number" value is zero, then, it's neither positive nor negative
8. Calculate the remainder by dividing the "number" value by 2
9. If the remainder equals zero, then it's an even number
10. If the remainder doesn't equal zero, then it's an odd number
